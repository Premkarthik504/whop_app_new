## 📊 Churn Prediction Algorithm Details

### Risk Factors (Weighted)
1. **Login Frequency (25%)**: Days since last login, login count trends
2. **Engagement Drop (20%)**: Recent vs historical activity comparison
3. **Payment Issues (20%)**: Failed payments, payment frequency
4. **Content Consumption (15%)**: Views, downloads, access patterns
5. **Session Duration (10%)**: Average time spent per session
6. **Message Activity (10%)**: Community participation levels

### Risk Levels
- **Low**: Score 0-20 (healthy engagement)
- **Medium**: Score 21-40 (monitor closely)
- **High**: Score 41-70 (intervention recommended)
- **Critical**: Score 71-100 (urgent action required)

### Confidence Scoring
Based on data availability:
- Member tenure (longer = more confident)
- Activity count (more data = better predictions)
- Metrics history (longer history = higher confidence)
- Payment history (establishes patterns)
